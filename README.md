# vs-project-dev

This is my personal log of C++ and other various projects worked on between my macbook (Branch vs-10) and my desktop (Branch win-10)

Contact me if you have any resources to learn C++ I would love to learn and research more!

Thank you

9/30 - Update

Managed to commit over 50 times in the last few days! Pretty big accomplishment as I am now able to comfortably sync status on my projects across 3 different environments, my macbook, my windows 10 work pc, and a windows 10 vm that sits on my macbook.
